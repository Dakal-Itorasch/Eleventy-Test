Hello i'm Dakal ! I'm your local derg (actually a kobold). I'm a somewhat an artist and a developper. It's hard to learn to draw... AHHHHH just free me from this HELL.

Also, i'm french, sorry about that (it's like a curse, i'm terrible at speaking or writing english *but i have a sweet baguette-like accent i guess*).

Alright ! This blog is a first for me. I want to write about me and the few things i do (eh, the little things i can show, i'm kinda shy about what i do).
Also i'm a Furry, yaayyyy.

And now i need to find **HOW I CAN DOWNSCALE THIS DAMM IMAGE RIGHT HERE**.
